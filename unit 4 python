To summarize:
When defining a function, placeholder variables are called parameters.
When using, or calling, a function, inputs into the function are called arguments.


def cube(number):
  return (number * number * number)


def by_three(number):
  if number % 3 == 0:
    return cube(number)
 
  else:
    return False
    
    
IMPORTS -  it’s best to stick with either 'import module' and type 'module.name' or just 'import' specific variables and functions from various modules as needed. 

You already know about some of the built-in functions we’ve used with strings, such as:
.upper() 
.lower() 
str() converts value into string
len()
max() returns greatest value
min()
abs() returns the absolute value of the number it takes as an argument (that number’s distance from 0 on an imagined number line)
type() function returns the type of the data it receives as an argument.


def distance_from_zero(num):
  if type(num) == int or type(num) == float:
    return abs(num)
  else:
    return "Nope"
